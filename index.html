    The Center for Computational Imaging & Visual Innovations (CIVI) is a research center under the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing, and Networking (AdRIC) at De La Salle University. We specialize in research projects centered towards solving real-world problems through deep learning solutions trained on visual data. Research projects under CIVI focus on specific goals, particularly (1) data collection, (2) model building and optimization, and (3) application development.
